# What is JARS?
JARS is an acronym for JAC Academic Reporting System. It is a collection of tools that is made to help with modern day academic reporting based on digital solutions. 
JARS is mainly divided into two major components:
- JARS DB (Database). This is where all data is centralized into one single platform for ease of access and simply reducing clutter on the user's end.
- JARS CReP (Custom Report Processor). This is a client software for JARS that is able to manipulate existing Excel-based score ledgers (grader report), generate student report cards, and access JARS DB while having maximum data manipulation capabilities.

# How to access JARS DB?
JARS DB is currently still under development.
